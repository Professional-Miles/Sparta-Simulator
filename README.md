### Introduction:

This project runs a simulation. The contents of this simulation include generating trainees to add to training centres before assigning them to clients. This simulation iterates certain actions on a month by month basis and the number of months that will be elapsed set by an initial USER input.

---

### Pre-requisites:

To run this project at least `java` 11 is required. A suitable IDE that supports `java` and dependencies for `Junit` and `Log4j`.

---

### How to install the Sparta Simulator:

Either copy and clone the GitHub repository to your local git or download the files to a directory of your choice.

Once that is done, you can open the project via your IDE.

---

### How to use the Sparta Simulator:

Navigate to the `SimulatorDriver` class and run the `main` method to prompt a USER input which must be entered before the simulation can start.

### Future additions:

- The simulation will include the ability for trainees to be added to a bench once they have bene trained for a year.

- The simulation will include clients who will take on trainees who are on the bench.

- The client will be able to return happily or never return unhappily if certain requirements are met.
